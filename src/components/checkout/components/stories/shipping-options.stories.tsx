### ShippingOptions Component

This component handles the shipping methods step of the checkout process - allowing customers to select from available shipping methods with different prices and delivery times. It uses a ToggleCard to show either an editable form or a summary view based on the step state.

**Key Features:**
- **Shipping Method Selection**: Radio button selection from available shipping methods
- **Price Display**: Shows shipping costs with promotion support — free, discounted (strikethrough), or standard pricing
- **Toggle States**: Shows edit form when \`isEditing\` is true, summary view when \`isEditing\` is false
- **Saving State**: Displays a spinner overlay and disables the submit button while a selection is being saved
- **Basket Integration**: Pre-selects the current shipping method from basket data; auto-submits the default method for returning customers

**Dependencies:**
- \`@/providers/basket\`: Access to current basket data, selected shipment, and shipping promotions
- \`@/components/toggle-card\`: Toggle between edit and summary views
- \`@/components/ui/radio-group\`: Radio button selection for shipping methods
- \`@/components/ui/button\`: Submit button
