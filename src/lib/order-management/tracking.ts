 * status-only entries (the render gate drops those, by design).
 *
 * Contract for consumers: this is the MAPPER's keep-filter, NOT a
 * "renderable" predicate. It deliberately keeps `status`-only entries so that
 * non-rendering consumers can read shipment status — but the tracking UI must
 * NOT assume every entry returned by {@link getOrderTrackingEntries} is worth
 * displaying. Anything that renders a tracking card or links to it must apply
 * `hasDisplayableTracking` (track-shipment.ts), which excludes `status`-only
 * entries (status is already conveyed by the shipping-status badge). Keeping the
 * two predicates separate is intentional: the mapper is the general source of
 * truth; the render gate is the display policy.

 *    delivery date would silently render "Dec 31, 1969".
 * 2. A truthy-but-unparseable string yields an Invalid Date, caught via
 *    `isNaN(getTime())`, so it renders nothing instead of throwing in
 *    downstream formatting.
 * 3. A truthy epoch-era sentinel string (e.g. `"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z"`) parses
 *    to a *valid* Date — the falsy check in guard 1 doesn't catch it — and would
 *    render "Jan 1, 1970". OMS does not currently send such a sentinel; this is
 *    cheap insurance if it ever does. (Note `new Date("0")` is year 2000, not the
 *    epoch, so this specifically targets truthy 1970-era strings.)
