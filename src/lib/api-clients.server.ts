/**
 * Wrap a base `fetch` so SCAPI requests within a single React Router request share fetches and invalidate on

 * for any custom clients so every SCAPI call routes through this wrapper, including those issued via the SDK's
 * `clients.auth.*` and `clients.basket.*` helpers.
 *
 * # Behavior
 *
 * - **Reads (GET/HEAD)**: identical concurrent calls share one underlying fetch promise. Cache key is
 *   `METHOD URL` with sorted query params. Each cache hit returns a `clone()` of the shared response so
 *   independent callers can each consume the body.
 * - **Mutations (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE)**: never cached. On settle (success or failure) they clear the entire
 *   registry so any subsequent read re-fetches. Concurrent in-flight reads are unaffected — they complete
 *   against their pre-mutation snapshot.
 * - **Rejections**: cached read entries are evicted on rejection so transient failures don't poison the cache.
 *
 * # Cache scope
 *
 * The registry is `WeakMap<RouterContextProvider, Map>`. Two requests cannot share entries even when their
 * URLs are byte-identical, and the per-request Map is dropped at end-of-request when the context is GC'd.
 *
 * # Cache key — what is keyed and what is not
 *
 * The key is `METHOD URL` with sorted query params. It does **not** include request headers or request body.
 * That is safe for this template because every header that varies between callers is derived from per-request context
 * inside `openapi-fetch` middleware, not from per-call state. Two concurrent calls under the same context produce
 * identical headers, and collapsing them into one network call doesn't change semantics.
 *
 * Customer extensions that add headers via custom middleware MUST follow the same discipline: derive header
 * values from `context`, not from per-call arguments. A header derived from per-call state (e.g. a multi-tenant
 * tenant ID resolved from a method argument) would cause cross-tenant cache hits within a single request and
 * silently leak data between callers. If you need per-call header variance, key on the header explicitly (extend
 * `buildDedupeKey`) or skip dedupe for that path.
 *
 * # Whole-registry invalidation on mutation — and why
 *
 * Any mutation clears the **entire** per-request registry, not just entries that look related to the mutated
 * resource. SCAPI domains are deeply interdependent and the dependency graph is not stable enough to model
 * statically in template code:
 *
 * - Adding to basket affects baskets, promotions (auto-applied), inventory, and recommendations.
 * - Updating the customer affects baskets (linked customer info), orders, and addresses.
 * - Placing an order clears the basket, appends to order history, and may update the customer.
 * - Changing locale or currency affects basket prices, product detail, search results, and content slots.
 * - Wishlist mutations affect product-display (in-wishlist marker) and customer-product-list summaries.
 *
 * Any narrower invalidation strategy (per-domain, per-URL prefix, tag-based) would have to encode this graph
 * in the template and stay correct as SCAPI evolves. The cost of being wrong is stale data on the page after a
 * mutation; the cost of being conservative is at most a handful of re-fetches inside a single SSR request, which
 * the dedupe itself collapses back to one network call per unique URL on the next render pass. We chose the
 * conservative default. Customers who can prove a narrower invariant for their storefront are free to replace
 * this fetch wrapper with one that exempts those mutations.
 *
 * # Middleware behavior — what cache hits change and what they do not
 *
 * openapi-fetch runs `onRequest` and `onResponse` middleware **per caller**, not once per underlying fetch. Per-
 * caller observability (per-call correlation IDs, per-call logger entries, per-call response inspection) works as
 * written.
 *
 * What a cache hit changes is **which Request actually goes over the wire**: when N callers collide on the same
 * key, the *first* caller's `onRequest` chain produces the Request that hits the network. Subsequent callers'
 * `onRequest` middleware still runs and still produces a Request, but that Request is discarded — they receive a
 * cloned copy of the shared Response. This is invisible as long as headers do not legitimately vary between
 * concurrent callers (see "Cache key" above). Logging shows real durations for the first caller and near-zero
 * durations for cache hits, which is the correct picture of what happened.
 *
 * # Abort handling
 *
 * The caller's signal — whether passed via `init.signal` or carried on a `Request` input — is **not** forwarded
 * to the underlying fetch. Instead, each caller's `await` is raced against its own signal: if the caller aborts,
 * their `await` rejects with an `AbortError`, but the shared underlying fetch keeps running for the benefit of
 * any other caller. This avoids the "first-caller's abort cascades to everyone else" hazard that a naive
 * shared-fetch design would produce.
 *
 * The trade-off is that an orphaned fetch (every caller has aborted) still runs to completion. For SSR within
 * a short-lived React Router request that's bounded and acceptable.
 *
 * @param context - React Router request context, used as the per-request cache key (WeakMap).
 * @param baseFetch - The underlying `fetch` implementation to call when a cache miss occurs.

/**
 * Wrap a base `fetch` with a hard timeout. When `timeoutMs` is `null`, returns `baseFetch` unchanged so the
 * wrapper has zero overhead and zero behavior change for environments that don't opt in. When `timeoutMs` is a
 * positive number, every call gets a fresh `AbortController` whose signal is forwarded to `baseFetch`; if the
 * timer fires before the fetch settles, the controller aborts the underlying network request with a
 * `DOMException('fetch timed out after Nms', 'TimeoutError')`.
 *
 * # Why "hard"
 *
 * Aborting the underlying fetch — not just the caller's `await` — is deliberate. With this layered *under* the
 * dedupe wrapper (see `createApiClients`), the abort propagates: the shared promise stored in the dedupe registry
 * rejects, the registry entry is evicted, and every caller awaiting that same promise (via `abortable(...)`)
 * rejects with the same `TimeoutError`. No orphaned in-flight fetch survives the timeout, and a subsequent call
 * to the same URL starts fresh.
 *
 * # Composition with `createDedupedFetch`
 *
 * Wrap `globalThis.fetch` with this helper, then pass the result into `createDedupedFetch`. That ordering means
 * **one timer per real network call**, not per caller — N concurrent callers colliding on the same dedupe key
 * share one timeout, and on expiry all N reject together. Reversing the order (dedupe inside, timeout outside)
 * would arm a fresh timer for every caller of a deduped fetch, which is wasteful and produces N log lines per
 * underlying timeout event.
 *
 * # Logging
 *
 * On timeout, emits exactly one `warn`-level log via the request-scoped logger:
 *
 *     [ApiClients] fetch timeout {METHOD} {maskedUrl}
 *         timeoutMs: 15000
 *
 * The URL is masked via `maskUrl()` so query values are not leaked. The existing `loggingMiddleware.onResponse`
 * inside `createApiClients` doesn't fire on timeout (no `Response` object), so this log line is the only
 * record of the timeout event at the fetch layer. Per-caller errors propagate through openapi-fetch's middleware
 * chain and surface to loaders/actions as the rejected `TimeoutError`.
 *
 * # Signal handling
 *
 * The caller's `AbortSignal` (from `init.signal`, or carried on a `Request` input per the fetch spec) is merged
 * with the timeout controller's signal via `AbortSignal.any`, so an abort from either source aborts the
 * underlying fetch. Whichever fires first wins; the rejection carries that source's reason
 * (`TimeoutError` for the timer, the caller's reason for an external abort).
 *
 * When this wrapper is composed *under* `createDedupedFetch` (the wired-in case for `createApiClients`), the
 * dedupe wrapper has already stripped the caller's signal from `init` and reconstructed any `Request` input with
 * a no-op signal. So the merge is functionally just the controller's signal, and caller aborts are still raced
 * against each caller's `await` separately by the dedupe wrapper. This means caller aborts never tear down the
 * underlying fetch in the dedupe-composed case, which is intentional: shared fetches must outlive any single
 * caller's abort. In standalone use (no dedupe), the merge ensures caller aborts reach the network.
 *
 * @param context - Used for the request-scoped logger. Not used as a cache or registry key.
 * @param baseFetch - The underlying `fetch` to invoke and time out.

 *
 * # Categories
 *
 * - **Load shedding** (resolve path). SCAPI advertises capacity pressure via response headers, documented at
 *   https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/commerce-api/guide/throttle-rates.html:
 *   - `sfdc_load` — system capacity in use, integer 0–100 (percent). Present only on origin-backed responses.
 *   - `sfdc_load_status` — `WARN` at 80% capacity, `THROTTLE` at 90%. Present on both the advertised (still-served)
 *     responses and the synthetic 503 the edge worker returns when it actually sheds a request.
 *
 *   The log **level is driven by HTTP status, not the header value**: a load signal on a served response (non-503)
 *   logs at `warn` (the request still succeeded); the shed `503` logs at `error`. On the shed 503 `sfdc_load` is
 *   absent (the worker generates the 503 itself and has no origin load value to copy through), so `load` is `null`.
 *
 *   Load shedding is **per-realm** and is **not applied** to checkout (Shopper Baskets/Orders) or OCI. `shopper/auth`
 *   (SLAS) does participate in edge load shedding and can emit `WARN`/`THROTTLE`; SLAS additionally has its own
 *   per-tenant token rate limits with no advance signal.
 *
 * - **Rate limiting** (resolve path). An HTTP `429` logs at `warn`, with the raw `Retry-After` header value recorded
 *   verbatim (`retryAfter`, or `null` when the header is absent).
 *
 * # Composition order
 *
 * Designed to sit *innermost* (closest to `globalThis.fetch`) so every real network response is observed once. Cache
 * hits served from `createDedupedFetch` do **not** re-emit a log — observation happens once per actual fetch.

 * Create Commerce API clients with authentication middleware.

 * API requests always target the B2C Commerce API endpoints directly (server-side). All SCAPI calls flow through
 * React Router loaders, actions, and resource routes.
 *
 * # Request-scoped fetch deduplication (opinionated reference implementation)
 *
 * The base `fetch` passed to the SCAPI clients is wrapped with `createDedupedFetch` so that identical concurrent
 * GET/HEAD calls within the same request share one underlying fetch promise, and any mutation
 * (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) clears the registry on settle. This is an opinionated optimization that ships with the
 * storefront template — customers are free to keep, modify, replace, or remove it entirely (different cache scope,
 * eviction strategy, observability hooks, alternative key construction, etc.). The only SDK surface it consumes is
 * the standard `fetch` injection point, which is openapi-fetch's public API.
 *
 * Because the wrapper sits at the `fetch` layer, it covers every SCAPI request — including those issued via the
 * SDK's `clients.auth.*` and `clients.basket.*` helpers. See `createDedupedFetch` for the full behavior, including
 * caveats around middleware on cache hits.
 *
 * # Hard timeout (opt-in)
 *
 * When the `MRT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` environment variable is set (Managed Runtime provides this to communicate the
 * platform's per-request budget), every outgoing SCAPI fetch is bracketed with a hard timeout sourced from
 * that value. The timeout layer sits *under* the dedupe layer, so one timer governs each real network call: on
 * expiry the underlying fetch aborts, the dedupe registry evicts the entry, and every caller awaiting the same
 * deduped promise rejects with a `TimeoutError`. When the env var is unset (or invalid) the wrapper is a no-op.
 * See `createTimeoutFetch`.
 *
 * ## Lifetime
 *
 * The registry is a module-local `WeakMap<RouterContextProvider, Map>`. Cache entries are dropped when:
 * 1. A mutation through any client settles — clears the registry so revalidating loaders re-fetch fresh data
 *    after actions that mutated SCAPI state.
 * 2. The request's `RouterContextProvider` is garbage-collected at end-of-request — the Map becomes unreachable.
 *
 * There's no timer, no LRU, no per-key TTL.
 *
 * ## No cross-request leakage
 *
 * Each request receives a fresh `RouterContextProvider`. Because the registry is keyed by that object and held in
 * a `WeakMap`, two requests never share a Map even if the underlying SCAPI URLs are byte-identical.
 *
 * ## Not a substitute for SCAPI server-side web-tier caching
 *
 * This dedupe layer is per-request, mutation-invalidated, and user-scoped — it collapses identical reads within a
 * single storefront request. SCAPI's server-side web-tier cache is cross-request, TTL-driven, and shared across users
 * for cacheable endpoints. The two layers are complementary, not substitutes: this one does nothing for cross-request
 * load, and SCAPI's cache does nothing for the N loaders/components in one render that all need the same basket.
