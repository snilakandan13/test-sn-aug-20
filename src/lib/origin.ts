 *
 * Reads the following request headers (no environment variables):
 * - `x-forwarded-host` — preferred; takes the first value if comma-separated
 * - `x-forwarded-proto` — preferred when present, else `https` (or `http`
 *   for an exact-match `localhost` host)
 * - `host` — fallback when forwarded headers are missing
 *
 * Trust model: this reads `x-forwarded-host` directly. That header is only
 * safe when the deployment is fronted by a proxy that strips client-supplied
 * values:
 * - On MRT, the eCDN does this and the Lambda function URL is not directly
 *   reachable, so the only path to the app is via the eCDN.
 * - In local dev the SDK's host-header middleware sets the value from
 *   `EXTERNAL_DOMAIN_NAME` when missing, so a developer's machine never
 *   reads an attacker-supplied header.
 *
 * If a deployment ever exposes the runtime directly (no eCDN, raw Lambda
 * function URL, etc.), an attacker could spoof `x-forwarded-host` and
 * poison the URL embedded in the magic-link / reset-password emails this
 * value feeds into. Don't add such a deployment shape without putting an
 * env-pinned canonical-host override in front of this resolver, mirroring
 * `getPublicOrigin` in `packages/storefront-next-ci/src/dashboard/lib/utils.ts`.

/**
 * Returns the application's origin.
 *
 * This function is isomorphic, it can be used on the client and server, but

 *
 * Server:
 * 1. The origin parsed from the in-flight `Request` stashed in `context` by
 *    `requestOriginMiddleware` (derived from `x-forwarded-host` /
 *    `x-forwarded-proto`). This is what lets a single deployment serve
 *    multiple custom domains correctly. Memoized per request.
 * 2. `EXTERNAL_DOMAIN_NAME` env var, for callsites without a context (e.g.
 *    bootstrap-time JWKS URLs).
 *
 * Client: always `window.location.origin`. The `context` argument is
 * intentionally ignored on the client — `requestOriginMiddleware` is server-only
 * (and not registered in `clientMiddleware` in `root.tsx`) because client
 * navigations don't have an incoming HTTP request with forwarding headers; the
 * `Request` the router synthesizes is a fetch-spec Request, not the original
 * eCDN-fronted one. `window.location.origin` already reflects the actual
 * public domain the user is browsing, which is what we want.
 *
 * Lives in its own module (rather than `lib/utils.ts`) so that broadly-imported
 * client utilities like `cn()` don't drag the request-origin middleware — and
 * its `react-router` `createContext` call site — into every client chunk.
 *
 * @env EXTERNAL_DOMAIN_NAME — Public hostname used as the bootstrap-time fallback
 *   when no router context is available. Optional. Example:
 *   `my-storefront.commercecloud.salesforce.com` or `localhost:5173`.
 *
 * @param context - Router context. Pass when available so the request's
 *   actual public origin is used rather than the env-var fallback. Ignored
 *   on the client (see above).
