/**
 * The shipped revalidation rules for SCAPI resource-route fetchers (`useScapiFetcher().load()`).
 *
 * This is an allowlist: a localized `load()` fetcher revalidates after a mutation only when a rule says so. The
 * default — no rule — is to NOT reload, because that is the entire reason `useScapiFetcher` exists over a page loader
 * (avoid refetching unrelated data on every interaction). Add a rule when a mutation provably changes the data a
 * fetcher reads.
 *
 * @remarks Each rule pairs a context predicate (`when`) with a resource predicate (`affects`); the two are ANDed
 * per fetcher, and rules are ORed across the set.
 *
 * **What this route governs.** Only the reads invoked through `useScapiFetcher().load()` flow through here:
 * `shopperBasketsV2.getBasket` (basket provider / mini-cart), `shopperProducts.getProduct` (cart-item and
 * bonus-product modals), `shopperProducts.getProducts` (store-scoped bulk inventory), and
 * `shopperSearch.getSearchSuggestions` (optionally with a `prices` expand). Every one of these reads is
 * priced/localized, which is why the global rule's `affects` is unconditional — see that rule's note. A SCAPI
 * write→read coupling that lands on a *page loader* or another resource route is gated there, not here.
 *
 * **Couplings deliberately left without a rule** (write provably stales a governed read, yet no reload is correct):
 * - Cart / promo / payment / place-order writes → `getBasket`: the action returns the new `basket` and the basket
 *   provider is updated from that result (`use-product-actions`, `use-checkout-actions` → `useBasketUpdater`), so the
 *   freshest copy already reaches consumers; a reload would re-fetch a basket the subtree already holds.
 * - Cart writes → product availability (`getProduct`/`getProducts`): adding to cart does not reserve inventory
 *   (SCAPI reserves only at order creation), so a basket change cannot stale a product's stock.
 * - Identity change (`/login`, `/signup`, `/logout`) → `getBasket`: the basket provider is persistent (root-mounted),
 *   so unlike the overlay fetchers it stays active across the identity redirect — but the login action merges the guest
 *   basket server-side (`mergeBasket` → `updateBasketResource`) before returning the redirect, so the re-running root
 *   loader returns the post-merge snapshot and the provider re-seeds from that prop plus the Set-Cookie snapshot on the
 *   same navigation. A fetcher reload would re-read a basket the provider already holds. The context dimension is
 *   matched via {@link isContextMutation}, which excludes the identity routes for exactly this reason.

// identical-args repeats of a single pass collapse to one walk, while two distinct mutations resolving in the same
// tick (e.g. `setSiteContext` then `updateShopperContext`) each get their own. The set is cleared after the burst via

/**
 * `shouldRevalidate` for the generic SCAPI resource route (`/resource/api/client/:resource`).
 *
 * React Router never tells this function which fetcher it's being consulted for. Every active `useScapiFetcher()`
 * fetcher gets the same args, so it cannot make a per-fetcher decision directly. Instead, it uses its own resource
 * as the post-mutation entry point: on the first call of a revalidation pass triggered by a mutation, it iterates the
 * fetcher registry and reloads exactly those registered fetchers whose decoded resource the {@link REVALIDATION_RULES}
 * policy says the mutation invalidates. It always returns `false` for the route's own fetchers — RR's blanket
 * auto-revalidation is replaced by this targeted, registry-driven reload.
 *
 * @remarks The registry walk is a deliberate side effect inside `shouldRevalidate` (normally pure). It is safe here:
 * client-only, idempotent within a pass (guarded by `walkedActionsThisTick`), and `reload()` is itself a
 * `fetcher.load()` that RR serializes. Navigations and loads (no `formMethod`/`formAction`, or `GET`) still walk once,
 * but no rule matches them, so nothing reloads.
 * @see {@link invokeMatchingFetchers}
