 * from either signal:
 *
 * - **Request URL** — the pathname ends in `.data`. This is the future-safe signal, but it only reaches middleware
 *   once the app preserves the suffix on `request.url` (react-router ≥ 7.13.2 with `v8_passThroughRequests`,
 *   stabilized from `unstable_passThroughRequests` in 7.15).
 *   On earlier versions of React Router, the suffix is stripped before middleware runs.
 * - **Response header** — the response carries `X-Remix-Response`. This works on react-router ≥ 7.3.0, where it is the
 *   only middleware-visible signal for a data response.

 * clearing within a couple of seconds. Every other cached 5xx (500–502, 504) is a genuine error with no backoff value,

/**
 * Middleware to keep CloudFront from caching 5xx error responses for longer than intended.
 *
 * On responses with status 500–504 (the 5xx subset CloudFront caches by default) it sets `Cache-Control: no-store` —
 * except for 503, which it lets cache briefly (`max-age=2`) as a deliberate overload backoff. See
 * {@link handleDataRequest} for the rationale behind the 503 carve-out.
 *
 * # Scope: React Router data interactions only
 *
 * The behavior is applied only to React Router single-fetch data interactions — the client-side navigations and
 * fetcher calls that hit `<route>.data` URLs and return a turbo-stream payload. Document (full-page HTML) responses are
 * left untouched, so CloudFront's default error caching still shields the document path. This keeps the backoff
 * behavior described below for the highest-volume entry point while preventing a stale cached error from sticking to an
 * in-session shopper's data fetches. See {@link isDataRequest} for how the two signals are detected.
 *
 * # Note / Warning
 *
 * CloudFront caches error pages for 10 seconds by default. This has built-in downsides, some serious. During traffic
 * spikes like flash sales or Black Friday, even occasional errors can snowball into large bursts, leaving many
 * customers stuck on error pages for a while. But permanently switching off error caching is a trade-off, not a clean
 * win. Error caching also acts as a backoff mechanism. When load is high and errors are not just sporadic, that
 * 10-second cache shields your backend from being hammered by repeated failing requests. Disable it, and you lose that
 * protection. By default, we therefore only apply this cache bypass behavior to 5xx responses. Any extensions or
 * customizations should be made carefully and should always account for orthogonal signals such as 429 responses or
 * the SCAPI-emitted sfdc_load_status and sfdc_load headers.
 *
 * # CloudFront / MRT distribution config (required)
 *
 * Experiments have shown that sending the `Cache-Control` header alone is sufficient to prevent the caching of error
 * responses/pages. However, this contradicts AWS’s own documentation. It's therefore recommended to adjust the default
 * value for CloudFront's *Error Caching Minimum TTL* setting for status codes 500, 501, 502, 503, 504 in parallel.
 *
 * # Placement
 *
 * Register on the **root route** so it covers responses produced by the ErrorBoundary render path. A deeper placement
 * would miss errors that bubble past the registered route. Place it as high up in the middleware stack as possible, at
 * least high enough to ensure that no other middlewares placed before it make any changes to the response headers.
