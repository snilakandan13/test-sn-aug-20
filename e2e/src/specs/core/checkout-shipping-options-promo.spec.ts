/**
 * Checkout Shipping Options - Promotional Pricing Display
 *
 * Validates that after a guest enters a shipping address, the shipping options
 * step stays open (radio group visible) so the shopper can review promotional
 * prices before continuing - instead of auto-advancing to the payment step.
 *
 * Uses the womens-jewelry-bundleM product on the global/en-GB site, which has
 * a free-shipping promotion on at least one shipping method.
 *
 * The site prefix (/global/en-GB) is intentionally hardcoded because this test
 * targets a specific site+locale combination. buildSitePath() would double-prefix
 * when SITE_ALIAS/LOCALE env vars are set, so we navigate directly via page object
 * methods that accept explicit prefixed paths.
